    '''
    Checks if a string is a palindrome. Palindromes are strings that are
    the same forwards as backwards.

        string (str): The string to be considered
    Returns:
        res (bool): True if string is a palindrome, False otherwise
    Examples:
        >>> is_palindrome("SoS")
        True
